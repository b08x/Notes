If you want to keep your changes associated with the detached HEAD
Run git branch tmp - this will save your changes in a new branch called tmp.
Run git checkout master
If you would like to incorporate the changes you made into master, run git merge tmp from the master branch. 
You should be on the master branch after running git checkout master.
